# Advancing Malicious Website Identification: A Machine Learning Approach Using Granular Feature Analysis

A collaborative study project between the University of Guelph, MITACS, and Arctic Wolf Networks to train a machine learning model to classify malicious websites with detailed granular classifications. This repository contains all of the code used to gather and aggregate data, train the model, and produce figures for analysis. The code used to gather and aggregate the data can be found in `data_construction`. The data can be found in `data` in a compressed format. The code used to train the models can be found in `experiments`. And the produced figures can be found in `figures`.

The repository also contains the produced dataset and figures. The dataset consists of 441707 samples: 235721 benign, 73345 phishing, 66490 command and control, 46009 spam, 16726 malware hosting, 3085 malicious advertisement hosting, 231 host scanners, 82 exploit kits, 12 credit card skimmers, 4 source exploits, and 2 web attackers.

We collected the data using various threat intelligence sharing platforms from IBM, abuse.ch, and LevelBlue Labs.
